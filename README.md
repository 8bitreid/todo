> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that creates new issues based on actionable comments in your code.

This is the website for the app. You can run it by following these steps:

0. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
0. Run `npm run build` to build the React bundle.
0. To deploy, run `npm run deploy`. This runs the JS files in the scripts folder.
