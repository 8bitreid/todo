This issue has been reopened because the `@todo` comment still exists in `index.js`, as of sha.

If this was not intentional, just remove the comment from your code. You can also set the [`reopenClosed`](https://github.com/JasonEtco/todo#configuring-for-your-project) config if you don't want this to happen at all anymore.
